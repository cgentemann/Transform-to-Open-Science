## NASA’s Open Source Science strategy is the key to bringing the data from these missions together into a single observatory to help understand the earth as a system and accelerate our ability to use this understanding. 

### FAQs on OSS
#### What is OSS?
Open-source science is a commitment to the open sharing of software, data, and knowledge (algorithms, papers, documents, ancillary information) from the start of research activities. The principles of OSS are to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. OSS is enabled by advances in technology, including collaboration tools and cloud computing and to align with changing norms among our community.
#### What is the difference between OSS and Open Science?
The primary difference is that open-source science commits to making the scientific process open from the start of research activities rather than making research results open once the research is complete and papers are published. The commitment to conduct research in the open supports greater participation in answering fundamental scientific questions and the use of publicly funded research, data, and analysis for societal benefit.  
#### What is the difference between OSS and Open Data? 
Open data is a critical component of Open Source Science. Other components of OSS include open documentation/publications, citizen science, challenges/prizes, open-source software, open peer review, open notebooks, and open educational resources among others.
#### Who can participate?
The goal is to allow anyone interested in advancing science to participate. To achieve this NASA’s ESD is modifying policies, starting new missions and implementing data processing and collaboration tools as open source science projects. 
#### How is OSS different from what we currently do?
ESD has over 25 years of leadership in making the data from missions available openly for any purpose with no period of exclusive access. This policy has allowed broad use of scientific data and encouraged other space agencies to share data in a similar manner. Open source science is an extension of the open principles to the research process. By leading the development of open source science capabilities NASA will enable greater participation in publicly funded mission science and encourage other organizations to do the same.
#### Is OSS a cultural or technical issue?
Both.
#### What is the Year of Open Science?
#### Does OSS mean free science? 
#### How does OSS impact ESO?
ESO missions, along with all new ESD activities, will incorporate OSS from the start of projects including commitments from international partners. ESO mission will:
- Starting in Phase-B 
- Science teams will be more inclusive and open -> Develop collaboration plans (template TBD)
- Initiate software, algorithms,  and documentation as open source
- Work with the ESDS program to identify common systems suitable for reuse and new capabilities that need to be developed.
- Responsible for production of products identified within PLRA

#### This sounds hard, what is the first step?
The first step is to support open source science efforts within your communities. The Turing Way (Welcome — The Turing Way) is a community-driven guide that provides more details on how to design open projects. The 2021 UNESCO recommendations (draft; https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation) have detailed definitions and suggestions on areas of action to support open science. 
#### What is the ESDS role in OSS?
#### What is the R&A role in OSS?
#### What is the Applied role in OSS?
#### What about international partners?
#### Are there different requirements for EV, directed, and research/ other missions?
No.
#### What incentives and disincentives are being used to encourage OSS?

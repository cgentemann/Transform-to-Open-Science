# Transform to OPen Science (TOPS)

Accelerating Scientific Discovery through Open Science

## Overview

* TOPS will act as a catalyst to jump-start a suite of coordinated activities designed to rapidly transform science 
* Designate 2023 as the Year of Open Science within a 5-year push to Transform to OPen Science. 


## Objective

* Accelerate science by motivating and supporting the science community’s move towards open science
* Broaden participation in science and empower historically excluded groups and institutions
* Normalize open science for the next generation of scientists that will participate in SMD missions


## Implementation
- 2022: Targeted investments to enable open science
- 2023: Kick off challenges and other activities to demonstrate the power of open science
- 2024: and beyond - Continue to harden support for open science
- Coordinate activities with scientific associations, institutions, philanthropic organizations, & move forward together

## Repository

This repository is used to openly share information about TOPS and the Year of Open Science. 
Issues are used to collect tasks for development, and Markdown text documents for any planning documents that need to be developed.   This could include linking to other resources. Please feel free to submit an issue or fork the repository to make a contribution. 


## Limitation
This repository will only be used for hosting content for documentation purposes. It will not be used for hosting code. A future version may involve code used to build a website. That will go through SRA (Software Release Authority) approval first. Documentation may be stored in different data formats, but the primary format for storing text documentation will be markdown. 

## Motivation and Plans

**We have lost the luxury of time**. COVID-19 catalyzed the scientific community and the response was dramatically accelerated by collaborative science - for example: sharing genome sequences, maps of ventilator availability, and analysis of transmission hotspots. This saved lives. This is how all of science should work, but even that highest-priority response only included a small fraction of the science community. Many scientists were unable to contribute because of outdated institutional policies around sharing information or they just didn’t know how to participate.

Scientists are trying to solve some of the most crucial and complex problems currently facing humanity. The need to quickly address pressing challenges means that the pace of science must accelerate, but responding will likely require analysis of unprecedented amounts of data and information. This means broadening participation, increasing accessibility to knowledge, and embracing new technologies.

Open science is “research conducted openly and transparently” (National Academies of Sciences, 2018). Open science advances science faster while enabling interdisciplinary collaborations leading to the breakthroughs we need to address the major challenges facing science. Many of the barriers to open science are rapidly falling away due to recent technological advances, creating an opportunity to transform how we do science. Adopting open science practices has the potential to lower the threshold for entry to marginalized communities, expand the science community, and increase opportunities for collaboration while promoting scientific innovation, transparency, and reproducibility. **Open science will increase the pace and quality of scientific progress.**

Open science begins with shared access to data, software, resources, and results (publications). Yet, openness that advances science is not a pure product of technology, it is a product of practices, norms, and community behavior around that technology. Just as new technology requires designing new workflows, it is important to deliberately design community dynamics that are welcoming to a more diverse community and strategically directs support to include marginalized groups. Our communities need to shift to open science now, but large shifts in community norms typically occur over decades. **The Transform to OPen Science (TOPS) project will coordinate efforts designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities.** These efforts will be aligned with the [2021 UNESCO draft Recommendation on Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation) ‘areas of action’ that are recommended to promote acceptance of open science.

Within TOPS, we will **designate 2023 as the Year Of Open Science (YOOS),** a global community initiative to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will shift the current paradigm.  Success will be assessed by the number of future science teams using these skills and designing their projects, from inception, around open science practices. **TOPS is only the starting point;** the science community needs agencies and organizations to make a long term commitment to support building an inclusive open science community over the next decade.

A TOPS steering team will set the vision, perform outreach and coordinate across other agencies and organizations. Each of the UNESCO ‘areas of action’ has a dedicated team and targeted activities.

**Targeted Activities, from the [2021 UNESCO draft Recommendation on Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation):**

1.  **Promoting a common understanding of Open Science, associated benefits and challenges, as well as diverse paths to Open Science.** Increase open science visibility through high-level support and communication strategies, create a TOPS steering team to organize activities, give colloquia, and build partnerships with companies, philanthropic groups, and institutions to advance open science activities.
    
2.  **Developing an enabling policy environment for Open Science.** The TOPS team will provide advice and guidance to agencies and organizations on targeted policy adjustments to allow for open science activities by federal employees and contractors.
    
3.  **Investing in Open Science infrastructures and services.** Support development of an open science infrastructure center of excellence that has a strong community-led base to advance interoperability and inclusivity, and can advance open infrastructures and FAIR cloud-optimized data and software.
    
4.  **Investing in human resources, education, digital literacy and capacity building for Open Science.** Support development of an open science education center of excellence that has a strong community-led base to advance open science literacy. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), collaboratively develop curriculum on open science and data science skills with open science certificates and badges. Leverage existing investments in trainings and support summer internships, summer schools, HackWeeks, Open Science Launchpads, and challenges.
    
5.  **Fostering a culture of Open Science and aligning incentives for Open Science.** Create open science awards, highlight successes, and integrate open science community building and practices into performance evaluations, research awards, and reporting.
    
6.  **Promoting innovative approaches for Open Science at different stages of the scientific process.** Integrate open science practises into citizen science, provide free, low-barrier path to large-scale research infrastructures (eg. interactive notebook deployments on commercial clouds).
    
7.  **Promoting international and multi stakeholder cooperation in the context of Open Science and in view of reducing digital and knowledge gaps.** Engage with international partners to participate in joint activities around open science, including open infrastructures, open MOOCs, international awards, and open metrics.
